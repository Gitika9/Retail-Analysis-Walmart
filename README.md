**In this project we focused retail analysis with Walmart data and answer the following questions:**
1. Which stores have maximum  and minimum sales?
2. Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot?. Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation.
3. Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate in Q3â€™2012?
4. Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together.
5. Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights.
